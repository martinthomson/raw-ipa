//! [`Buffer`] describes the functionality needed to have a distributed read/write buffer between the
//! network layer and compute layer. It is needed because running pipelines send data to other
//! running pipelines asynchronously, and so there must be a way to await the data until the
//! receiving pipeline is ready. This provides a storage layer for that data to wait in.
//!
//! As of now, the only implementation is [`Mem`], which is an in-memory hashmap. While other
//! implementations are possible, it's likely that the latency associated with a file read/write
//! would be too large to associate with every piece of data sent.
//!
//! See [`mem`] for an example usage of [`Buffer`].
